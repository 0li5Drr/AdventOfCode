Little debrief to Task 5:
- Clear code redundancy, that should probably be refactored into methods to make easier.
- In general, feeling more confident using Iterators, and remembering how useful pattern matching can be.
- Remembering to put mut next to declarations is an uphill battle :sweat_smile:
